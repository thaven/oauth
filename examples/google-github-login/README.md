# Google-Github Example

If you want to try running this example, please register as a Github and Google developer and create apps. Be sure to use the correct redirect URIs (check `oauthimpl.d`).
Lastly, you need to export the environment credentials to the app as follows:

```sh
export GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENTID="..."
export GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENTSECRET="..."

export GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENTID="foo.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENTSECRET="..."
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_PROJECTID="project123..."
```
